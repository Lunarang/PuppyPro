Puppy Pro is a CRUD capable and MVC structured app using Sinatra framework. Essentially, it's a simple Content Management System (CMS). It was created with the intent to give the user a way to track their puppy's training progress. The initial goals of the app were to allow the user to:

‚úèÔ∏è Sign up for an account
üê∂ Add/remove multiple puppies
üîßCreate/delete puppy skills (sit, down, speak, etc)
‚ùì Manage what skills their puppy knows
‚¨ÜÔ∏è Manage the proficiency level of said skills
üåü View a list of mastered skills
üìà View a visual timeline of mastered skills
